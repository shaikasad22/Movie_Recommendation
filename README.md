# Movie Recommendation System using Python

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python. It leverages data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences, ratings, and similarities between films. The system demonstrates both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, providing personalized recommendations to users.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using pandas and NumPy
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights using matplotlib and seaborn
- Content-based filtering using cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization
- Collaborative filtering using user-item matrix and correlation analysis
- Hybrid recommendation approach combining both models
- Interactive recommendation output (terminal or web-based interface)

## Tech Stack
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Flask (optional for deployment)

## Dataset
Uses the MovieLens dataset or any custom dataset containing movie titles, genres, ratings, and user IDs.

## Outputs
- Top-N movie recommendations for a given user or title  
- Visualization of user preferences and popular trends  

## Future Improvements
- Integration with a web UI for live user input
- Incorporation of deep learning models for improved accuracy
- Real-time recommendation API support
